# Presentation

 Gravitee is an open source API platform developed by [gravitee.io](https://www.gravitee.io/).

A buildpack is a set of scripts which aims at:

 - Detecting the language of an application (**detect**)
 - Installing the dependencies of a project (**compile**)
 - Defining how the application should be started (**release**)

# Architecture of a Buildpack

 A buildpack has three mandatory entrypoints:

 - bin/detect: exit with success (return code is 0) if the buildpack
   applies to the current application.
 - bin/compile: installs the technology.
 - bin/release: handles some metadata.

**All these entrypoints are Bash script.**

Script detect:   The purpose of the script located in bin/detect is to detect if the buildpack applies to the application.
>  It takes the build directory in argument. If the buildpack is applicable, the script must
> print on the standard output the name of the technology and return  with the code 0.

Script compile:   The purpose of the script located in bin/compile is to actually compile the application. It is called with three   arguments:
> The build directory: contains the code of the application.
> The cache directory: used to store information one want to keep between two builds.
> The environment directory: contains a  file per environment variable defined.

Script release:   The purpose of the script located in bin/release is to generate some metadata about the application.
> It takes the build directory in argument.

# Gravitee Information

Current deployed version of Gravity: **3.8.3**

4 different apps should be configured using this very same buildpack. Each app
must have the right value of the environment variabel `GRAVITEE_MODULE`

## Description of the modules

### graviteeio-rest-api

Configuration REST API allowing to manipulate all the resources of Gravitee.

This module is a java application, the JDK will be automatically installed just like another java application.

### graviteeio-gateway

Entrypoint of all applications and APIs configured in Gravitee.

This module is a java application, the JDK will be automatically installed just like another java application.

### graviteeio-portal-ui

Developer Dashboard allowing developers to configure their access to the APIs/Applications deployed through Gravitee.

This module is a static app, the buildpack download nginx to serve the assets

### graviteeio-management-ui

Static Frontend to administrate Gravitee.

This module is a static app, the buildpack download nginx to serve the assets

## Configuration

Some environment variables must or can be configured.
